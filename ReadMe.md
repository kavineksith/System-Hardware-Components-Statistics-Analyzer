# System Analyzing and Monitoring Documentation

## Overview
This Python script provides comprehensive system monitoring capabilities, offering insights into various aspects of system performance and configuration. It covers functionalities such as battery usage statistics, CPU usage, disk management, memory usage, network statistics, process management, system information overview, and more. The script utilizes the `psutil` library for accessing system-related information and generating reports with date-time stamps.

## Features
- **Battery Usage Statistics**: Displays battery percentage, power connectivity status, and remaining battery time.
- **CPU Usage Monitoring**: Provides CPU usage percentage, processor cores count, system CPU times statistics, CPU frequencies, and CPU stats.
- **Disk Management**: Offers storage overall report, storage statistics report, and storage level checker.
- **Memory Usage Statistics**: Presents system memory usage statistics including total memory, available memory, percentage used, and swap memory statistics.
- **Network Usage Statistics**: Shows network connectivity status, network traffic analysis, and extra information about network packets.
- **Process Management**: Lists system process IDs and their names.
- **System Information Overview**: Retrieves basic system information such as operating system details, processor identity, machine type, and more.

## Script Components
